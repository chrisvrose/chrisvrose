## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Atreya (aka chrisvrose/kekvrose/...). I'm pursuing my postgraduate studies at UCL, and I work on a bit of everything :).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on - advpi, a Gameboy Advance Emulator, but using VMs.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything programming. If I'm not aware of it, I'd always love to learn more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first "program" was made using GameMaker. [Here it is!](https://www.yygarchive.org/game/198613)
