## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Atreya (aka chrisvrose/kekvrose/...)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
  - [estree-visualize](https://viz.kekvrose.me) - A way to visualise ESTree ASTs.
  - advpi - A GBA emulator, but with supercharged virtualisation using a Raspberry PI.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything programming. If I'm not aware of it, I'd always love to learn more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first "program" was made using GameMaker. [Here it is!](https://www.yygarchive.org/game/198613)
