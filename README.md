## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Atreya (aka chrisvrose/kekvrose/...)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - `estree-visualize` - A way to visualise and generate code from ESTree ASTs.
  - `advpi` - A GBA emulator, but with supercharged virtualisation using a Raspberry PI.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything programming. If I'm not aware of it, I'd always love to learn more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first "program" was made using GameMaker. [Here it is!](https://www.yygarchive.org/game/198613)
