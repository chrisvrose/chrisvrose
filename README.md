## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Atreya (aka chrisvrose/kekvrose/...). I'm pursuing my postgraduate studies at UCL, and I enjoy working on projects that I can apply in day-to-day scenarios.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on - advpi, a Gameboy Advance Emulator, but using VMs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with emulators.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything programming. If I'm not aware of it, I'd always love to learn more.
