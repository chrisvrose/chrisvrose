## Hi there 👋

I'm Atreya (aka chrisvrose/kekvrose/...)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - `imapalyze` - A TUI interface to see a breakdown of who's sent you all those unread mails.
  - `pico_timer` - A TUI interface on a PI to see temperature and time. Bonus if I can sync the time from my phone.
- 💬 Ask me about anything programming. If I'm not aware of it, I'd always love to learn more.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first "program" was made using GameMaker. [Here it is!](https://www.yygarchive.org/game/198613)


Note: I'm transferring some of my repositories into [Kekwtea](https://tea.kekvrose.me). See you there :) !
